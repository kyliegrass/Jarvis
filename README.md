# Jarvis

<strong>Introduction:  </strong>Inspired by the iconic movie Ironman, I present the first version of Jarvis. This system completes mundane tasks through voice commands, allowing users to multitask on other important projects.

                            <strong>Background: </strong>Jarvis is integrated with ChatGPT 3.5 turbo, enabling us to give commands similar to those given to Siri or Bixby. In addition to parsing the internet for answers, Jarvis can empty the recycle bin, organize files, and even delete duplicates.

                            <strong>Approach:</strong><br>
                              User Research: After watching the classic Ironman movie more times than is probably healthy, I realized that with current technology, it was possible to build my own version of Jarvis.<br><br>

                              UX Audit: Jarvis version 1 runs in the Windows terminal. Future versions will feature more advanced visuals and perhaps even the beloved English accent.<br><br>

                              Development and Testing: I found a tutorial online that helped me connect the ChatGPT API. Through personal experience and additional research, I was able to call all necessary functions in Python. The user's computer must have a built-in microphone set as default. Commands must be spoken exactly as written, for example, "delete file ABC.pdf." Currently, more complex commands like "delete the file on the left of my screen" are not supported.<br><br>

                              Optimization: Additional versions, currently in testing, offer the option to connect IoT home devices. This allows for commands to be executed with minimal delay, such as:<br>

                              - Make a Nespresso<br>
                              - Dim the kitchen lights<br>
                              - Remind me to grab treats for Appa<br><br>

                            <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
                              The first version of Jarvis demonstrates the potential of integrating voice command technology with everyday tasks, creating a more efficient and hands-free user experience. As development continues, future versions will expand functionality, offering more complex commands, improved user interface, and broader IoT integration. This project reflects the exciting possibilities at the intersection of artificial intelligence and practical application, paving the way for more advanced and user-friendly digital assistants.
